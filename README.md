## Examples

### Result

What is a `Result`? It's a representation of the outcome of an operation *which may have failed*. Kind of like `java.util.Optional`.

Like `Optional`, it wraps a value, and like `Optional`, it doesn't allow you to use that value directly. 
After all, if it's representing a failed operation, there may not *be* a value.
In order to extract a value, you have to define how to handle the failure cases.

However, an `Optional` is either *present*, and contains a value, or *absent*, conveying no information. 
A `Result`, however, is either a *success*, containing a value, or a *failure*, containing information about the failure.


#### Creating a Result from a value: Introducers

The simplest way to create a `Result` is simply to instantiate either a success or failure value, as appropriate.
For example, the following code creates a successful `Result`, followed by a failed `Result`.

```java
Result<Integer, String> firstResult = Result.success(42);
Result<Integer, String> secondResult = Result.failure("What is six times nine?");
```

There are also many common repeated patterns of operations which can fail. 
For example, you may have some code which creates `Optional`s, which you would like 
to convert to `Result`s in order to better track failure causes. 

For this, [`co.unruly.control.result.Introducers`](https://javadoc.io/page/co.unruly/control/latest/co/unruly/control/result/Introducers.html) 
contains a selection of useful functions which yield `Result`s:

```java
public Result<Integer, String> asResult(Optional<Integer> maybeNumber) {
    return with(maybeNumber, fromOptional(() -> "No number found. :("));    
}
```

#### Composing operations on a Result: Transformers

`Result` is most useful when modelling an operation as a sequence of smaller operations, each using
the output of the last step, and some of which can fail. The most common operations here are `onSuccess()` 
and `attempt()`.

Invoking `onSuccess(f)` on a `Result` will apply `f` to the value in the `Result` if it's a success, yielding a 
new success. If the original `Result` was a failure, `f` will not be invoked and the original failing `Result` will
be returned.

If you have a function `f` which can fail - i.e. a function which returns a `Result` - then invoking `attempt(f)` will
apply `f` to the value in the `Result` if it's a success, yielding a new `Result` which may be either a success or 
failure. If the original `Result` was a failure, `f` will not be invoked and the original failing `Result` will
be returned.

This allows us to chain together a sequence of calls to `onSuccess` and `attempt` to specify what to do on the
happy path, and cascade any failure cases together to be handled once.

For example, if we want to write a bestselling novel, then there are various steps towards getting it published. 
We need to have an idea, secure an advance, write the manuscript, get it edited, get it published, and rocket up the bestseller charts.

Getting the idea, securing an advance and finishing the manuscript are definitely steps which can fail.
However, given success in the other steps, editing and publishing are mechanical steps we can have confidence will succeed, 
and once those are complete we can then release the novel and (eventually) count the total sales.

If any of the steps fail, no novel is published, and we can look at the error message from whenever the process failed.

We could therefore model the process as follows:

```java
public static String describeNovelSales(Author author, Publisher publisher, Editor editor, Retailer retailer) {
    return author.getIdea()
            .then(attempt(publisher::getAdvance))
            .then(attempt(author::writeNovel))
            .then(onSuccess(editor::editNovel))
            .then(onSuccess(publisher::publishNovel))
            .then(onSuccess(retailer::sellNovel))
            .then(onSuccess(sales -> format("%s sold %d copies", sales.novel, sales.copiesSold)))
            .then(collapse());
}
```

Whilst `onSuccess()` and `attempt()` are the most common ways to transform a `Result` into another `Result`,
other use cases exist. A collection of such functions exists in 
[`co.unruly.control.result.Transformers`](https://javadoc.io/page/co.unruly/control/latest/co/unruly/control/result/Transformers.html).

#### Extracting a value from a Result: Resolvers

The simplest way to extract a value from a `Result` is to simply describe what to do with a failure value.
For example, the following method takes a `Result` of either an `Integer` 
or a `String` describing the failure, and returns the wrapped integer if it was a success,
or -1 if it was a failure:

```java
public Integer extractValue(Result<Integer, String> count) {
    return count.then(ifFailed(x -> -1));
}
```

Sometimes, the success and failure types are the same. In that case, you can simply
collapse both cases to a single value:

```java
public static void main(String ...args) {
    printResult(Result.success("This was a triumph!"));
    printResult(Result.failure("The cake is a lie"));
}


public static String printResult(Result<String, String> value) {
    System.out.println(value.then(collapse()));
}
```
Which outputs:
```
> This was a triumph!
> The cake is a lie
```

`ifFailed` and `collapse` can both be found in 
[`co.unruly.control.result.Resolvers`](https://javadoc.io/page/co.unruly/control/latest/co/unruly/control/result/Resolvers.html)
, along with a selection of other functions to convert `Result`s into non-`Result` values.

#### Functional API

None of the operations described above are methods on the `Result` object. 
Instead, `Result` presents only two methods: `Result.either()` and `Result.then()`.

##### Result.either()

`Result.either` takes two functions, one for the success case and one for the failure case.
If the `Result` is a success, it applies the first function to its success value and returns the result.
If it was a failure, instead it applies the second function.

```java
public static void main(String ...args) {
    printResult(Result.success(99));
    printResult(Result.failure("bananas"));
}


public static String printResult(Result<String, String> value) {
    System.out.println(value.either(
        success -> success + " bottles of beer on the wall",
        failure -> "Yes sir, we have no " + failure    
    ));
}
```

Which outputs:
```
> 99 bottles of beer on the wall
> Yes sir, we have no bananas
```

Note that the argument types of the functions must match the corresponding success
and failure types, and both functions must return the same type.

##### Result.then()

`Result.then` takes a function from a `Result` to a value, and then applies
that function to the result. The following lines of code are (other than generics inference issues) equivalent:
```java
ifFailed(x -> "Hello World").apply(result);
result.then(ifFailed(x -> "Hello World"));
```

By structuring the API like this, instead of having a fixed set of methods available, we can
create more specialised functions for domain-specific use cases and mix them seamlessly with 
standard operations, and customise how we interact with `Result`s.

The functions included in this library are all higher-order functions, returning
instances of `Function`. This includes functions to create `Result`s from non-`Result`
values - both for consistency, and compatibility with idiomatic `Stream` usage. 
As non-`Result` values don't implement `then()`, and there are both readability and
generics issues, we also include `Piper`.

##### Piper

This approach is slightly more cumbersome than it could be, as Java's ability to infer 
generic types is not particularly great. For example, the following code doesn't compile:

```java
public Result<Integer, String> asResult(Optional<Integer> maybeNumber) {
    return fromOptional(() -> "No number found. :(").apply(maybeNumber);    
}
```
This fails to compile because the type of `fromOptional` is inferred to be 
`Function<Optional<Object>, Result<Object, String>`, because the type inference 
engine can't infer the success type based on subsequent operations (namely, the type
passed to `apply()`).

Enter [`Piper`](https://javadoc.io/page/co.unruly/control/latest/co/unruly/control/Piper.html). 
A `Piper` is simply a box for a value: 

```java
Piper<Integer> pipe = Piper.pipe(42);
```

You can then chain functions on the pipe:

```java
Piper.pipe(42)              // yields a Pipe containing 42
     .then(x -> x + 10)     // yields a Pipe containing 52
     .then(x -> x * 2)      // yields a Pipe containing 104
     .resolve()             // returns 104
```

This allows us to rewrite our failing-to-compile example from above as:

```java
public Result<Integer, String> asResult(Optional<Integer> maybeNumber) {
    return pipe(maybeNumber)                                // Pipe of Optional<Integer>
        .then(fromOptional(() -> "No number found. :("))    // Pipe of Result<Integer, String>
        .resolve();                                         // Result<Integer, String>               
}
```

For short examples like this, there's also a `resolveWith()` method:

```java
public Result<Integer, String> asResult(Optional<Integer> maybeNumber) {
    return pipe(maybeNumber)                                
        .resolveWith(fromOptional(() -> "No number found. :("));
}
```

`Piper.then()` functions in the same way as `Result.then()`: it applies the provided function
to its contents. This means we can build a functional pipeline which includes both regular 
values and Results:

```java
Result<Integer, String> result = pipe("a=1234;")                            // Piper<String>
        .then(pattern::matcher)                                             // Piper<Matcher>            
        .then(ifIs(Matcher::find, m -> m.group(1)))                         // Piper<Result<String, Matcher>>
        .then(onFailure(__ -> "Could not find group to match"))             // Piper<Result<String, String>>
        .then(attempt(tryTo(Integer::parseInt, ex -> ex.getMessage())))     // Piper<Result<Integer, String>>
        .resolve();                                                         // Result<Integer, String>
```

Note that the use of `Piper.then()` is identical to the way we'd use `Result.then()`, except now we
can directly chain from non-failable states into failable states.
